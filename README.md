## Description

This is my professional portfolio as a front end web developer. I created it so I can easily share a little about me and my experience, to showcase my past and current deployed projects, and to allow potential employers or collaborators to get in touch with me through my contact details.

This was a great project to work on, as creating the portfolio site itself was a challenge that I learnt a lot from.

One key learning point was the importance of link paths being written correctly, as while they may render correctly at the local level, they may not do so once the project is deployed if the paths are not accurate.

In the future, I expect to re-work this project and update it to be more in line with my upgraded skill set.

## Installation

N / A

## Usage

This website is aimed at potential employers, collaborators, and industry colleagues for them to get a good grasp of my current intrests, abilities and skillset.

 Through the navigation bar of the website, users can easily get to the sections they're interested in.

 The first section is the 'About' section, containing some information about my skills, values and experience and a call to action to get in touch.

 I have also added an avatar which contains my photo and a few fun elements that highlight my skillset while transmitting my warm, fun and creative personality.

The work section contains four of my past and current projects, which users can check out by clicking the project links. This will lead them to the deployed applications.

The last section of the website contains my contact details and the footer with a short copyright statement. By clicking the links in the contact section, users can email me directly, or connect with me on Github or LinkedIn.

Lastly, a big part of this project was making sure that it is accessible and responsive for different viewports and devices. This is why I have designed it to be mobile-first, with the layout of the website looking slightly different with all the content aligned on one column only. 

Then, I used media queries to make sure that the content looks pleasant and interesting, in alignment on different viewport sizes.

If you encounter any issues with the accessibility of this website, please let me know.

Lastly, when deploying the website, I encountered an error with my CSS code, which was solved thanks to this Stack Overflow thread, where I have found the solution to my problem:
